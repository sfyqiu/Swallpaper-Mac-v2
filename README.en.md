---

## 🌐 Network Requirements

> ⚠️ **Note for users in mainland China**

Swallpaper's primary data source, [Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc), is hosted on overseas servers. **Direct access from mainland China may be affected by network restrictions.** If you experience issues loading content, please ensure your network can access international websites.

---

## 🛠 System Requirements

- **macOS 14.0+** (Sonoma or later)
- Supports both **Apple Silicon (M-series)** and **Intel** Macs

---

## 🔧 Rule Engine

Swallpaper uses a dynamic rule system with scraping logic decoupled from the client:

- Rules are hosted in a separate repository: **[Swallpaper-Profiles](https://github.com/sfyqiu/Swallpaper-Mac-Profiles)**
- Latest rules are automatically synced on app startup
- Supports custom user-imported rules
- When source site layouts change, only rules need updating — no app release required

```
App Launch → Check for Updates → Load Latest Rules → Ready to Use
                    ↑________________________|
                     (Auto-sync when remote repo updates)
```

## ☕ Support Open Source

Swallpaper is a **completely free and open-source** personal project. Developing and maintaining a native macOS application requires significant time and effort — from UI design and feature implementation to bug fixes and rule adaptations, every version is built on continuous personal dedication.

If you find Swallpaper helpful, please consider supporting its continued development:

Swallpaper is **NOT an official Wallpaper Engine product** and has **no official partnership, sponsorship, or affiliation** with Valve Corporation, Kristjan Skutta / Wallpaper Engine, or their associated entities.

This application is provided **"AS IS"**, and the developer assumes no liability for:
- Content loading failures caused by network fluctuations, third-party service changes, or source-site blocking
- Rendering anomalies, crashes, or hardware damage caused by user device configurations, system updates, or driver compatibility issues (particularly OpenGL / GPU drivers)
